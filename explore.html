                <h3>Here are the top 5 reasons why you should start your own podcast:</h3>
                   <ol class = "list">
                       <li><h5>Audio content is convenient for the consumer</h5>
                        I think it was Seth Godin who said that as marketers, what we are competing for most is someone’s attention. 
                        There is an overwhelming amount of information available to all of us, coupled with so many distractions, 
                        that focusing 100% of our attention on one specific piece of content (an article or a video for example) is
                         becoming increasingly difficult to do.
                        It’s difficult to ignore everything else that 
                        wants your attention to focus 100% of your attention on reading an article or watching a video in its entirety.
                        The great thing about a podcast is that your content is audio, and can be consumed while the listener is 
                        also doing something else. They can multi-task. Someone can listen to your podcast while cleaning their 
                        house, driving in their car, jogging, or exercising at the gym. Doing so doesn’t distract them from their
                        current activity, it enriches it. Audio content is portable and convenient.</li>

                        <li><h5>To build an audience</h5>
                        Just like with a blog, a podcast is a way for you to build an audience. As your podcast grows in popularity,
                        the size of your audience increases. Not everyone who listens to your show will come back for more, but the
                        ones who like your style and your content will become loyal listeners. They will recommend your show to others,
                        and over time you will build a tribe of fans eager to hear your next episode.
                        Hosting your show on platforms such as iTunes or Stitcher will also expose your show to new listeners who find
                        your show by searching for specific topics on those platforms. For example, if you host a show about cooking,
                        someone looking for a podcast about cooking will find your show if it appears in the search results for that keyword.</li>

                        <li><h5>It doesn’t cost much to get started</h5>
                        If you wanted to start podcast 10 years ago, you would have likely had to spend several thousand dollars on equipment
                        just to get started. Fortunately, this is no longer the case. When I launched my podcast in 2013, I spent about $250
                        on equipment. And since then the cost for the same equipment has come down by nearly 50%.
                                
                        There are only a few pieces of equipment required to host your show. The first is of course a computer (or laptop) 
                        with an internet connection. From there, your basic essentials are a microphone, headset, and a pop filter.
                        I currently use a Blue Yeti microphone, a pair of Sony headphones, and a pop filter.  I recently found a similar 
                        combination (different headphones) of equipment on Amazon for $139.99. Very good deal.</li>

                        <li><h5>To increase the size and value of your network</h5>
                        If you host a podcast in which you interview various guests for your show, one of the most obvious benefit of doing 
                        so is that you get to expand your network. A podcast is a great platform to leverage to reach out to people you might
                        not have been able to otherwise. As your audience grows in size, your ability to reach out to the high profile 
                        experts in your industry increases.
                                    
                        Every person you invite to be a guest on your show can potentially become a valuable contact for life. As I write
                        this article, I’ve interviewed over 70 guests for my podcast, and I’ve kept in touch with nearly all of them. Some 
                        of them have become very close friends, and in many cases we have worked together on certain projects or simply 
                        shared ideas to help each other succeed.</li>

                        <li><h5>You can make money from your show</h5>
                        A podcast doesn’t have to be a hobby. There are ways you can make money from your show. John Lee Dumas 
                        (host of Entrepreneur On Fire) is an expert at this. His generates multiple 5 figures per month from sponsors 
                        alone, and has taught thousands of people how to monetize their podcast. You are welcome to listen to the
                        interview I did with John by clicking here.
                                        
                        There are a few ways you can monetize your podcast. If your download numbers are high enough, you can charge
                        sponsors to be mentioned on your show. You can also use your show to promote your own products or services 
                        (books, courses, or consulting, for example). Another option is to include a recommended resources section 
                        on your show’s main website, and include affiliate links in each of the recommendations. This way, when 
                        someone clicks on a recommended resources and decides to buy, your earn a commission from the sale.
